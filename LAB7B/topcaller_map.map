WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator L0/LCD_E_and00001 failed to merge with
   F5 multiplexer L0/LCD_E_mux0000244_SW0_SW0.  There is a conflict for the
   FXMUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.

Number of warnings:    1
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           702 out of   9,312    7%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             1,870 out of   9,312   20%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            964 out of   4,656   20%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     964 out of     964 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     964   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       1,903 out of   9,312   20%
    Number used as logic:             1,870
    Number used as a route-thru:         33

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 15 out of     232    6%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     1 out of      24    4%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                4.53

Peak Memory Usage:  589 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  2 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   2 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
